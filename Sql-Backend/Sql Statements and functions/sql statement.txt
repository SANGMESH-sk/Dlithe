select avg(ID),designation from students group by designation

select avg(ID),designation from students group by designation  order by designation ASC
select avg(ID),designation from students group by designation having avg(ID)>2  order by designation ASC

select * from students where designation in('it', 'hr')
select * from students

update students set designation ='it' where name='sam'
